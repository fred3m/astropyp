Telescopes and Instruments
==========================

To make it easier for observers to get started on a new telescope or instrument,
one of the goals of astropyp is to build up a collection of pipelines for a variety
of instruments. You are encouraged to add a new pipeline if any of your instruments
are not currently supported.
